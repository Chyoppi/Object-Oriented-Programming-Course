#8. Code a simple (and textual) implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Play until either you or the computer gets 3 wins. Use functions. a. Plan your game first and code piece by piece: read input from user, generate random number to get computerâ€™s choice, then check who wins and keep track of victories.
